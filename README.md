## III. CALCULATION
### 1.CAC: Customer Acquisition Cost
`CAC = [Total Sales and Marrketing Expenses] / [Number Of New Cusstomers Acquired]`

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) is calculated by dividing the total Sales & Marketing expensesâ€”including marketing software costs, salaries, and daily marketing spendâ€”by the number of new customers acquired.

### 1.1 Marketing Software Expense
```
month_expense.sample(5)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c318338e-bf9a-4e36-aa4f-1f9d5165cdb7)

```
expense_mar = monthly_expense[monthly_expense['month'] == '2023-03-01']
expense_crm = expense_mar[expense_mar['item'] == 'Salesforce']['amount'].sum()
```
> The cost of the Marketing Software Expense is $1,700.
> In March 2023, we extracted the Marketing Software Expense by filtering for the item "Salesforce", which totaled $5,950. This amount is included in the total marketing cost used to calculate the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

### 1.2 Sales & Marketing Salaries
```
pay_roll.sample(5)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9efe5ec-f922-44d1-b29d-c10be8793404)
```
pay_roll_202303 = pay_roll[pay_roll['month'] == '2023-03-01']
sale_marketing_salary = pay_roll_202303[
    (pay_roll['department'] == 'Sales') |
    (pay_roll['department'] == 'Marketing')
]['paid'].sum()
```
> The cost of Sales & Marketing Salaries is $5,950.
> In March 2023, the total amount paid to employees in the Sales and Marketing departments was $5,950. This value represents the Sales & Marketing Salaries, and is included in the total expense used to calculate Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

### 1.3 Daily Marketing Expense
```
daily_marketing.sample(5)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/017335a9-31aa-4fcc-a607-b6270c0df0ca)

```
daily_marketing_202303 = daily_marketing[(daily_marketing['date'] >= '2023-03-01') & (daily_marketing['date'] <= '2023-03-31')]
daily_marketing_expense = daily_marketing_202303['spending'].sum()
```
> The cost of the Daily Marketing Expense is $68,830.
> In March 2023, the total Daily Marketing Expense amounted to $68,830. This value is included in the total marketing cost for calculating the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

### 1.4 Number of New Customer
```
customer_recepts.sample(5)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85474fa0-a856-494d-81f1-9d2fe8e67de5)

```
customer_recepts_202303 = customer_recepts[(customer_recepts['date'] >= '2023-03-01') & (customer_recepts['date'] <= '2023-03-31')]
new_of_customer = customer_recepts_202303[customer_recepts_202303['new_customer'] == 1]['customer_id'].nunique()
```
>The number of new customers is 63.

### 1.5 CAC calculation
```
total_acquition_cost = crm_expense + sale_marketing_salary + daily_marketing_expense
cac = round(total_acquition_cost/ new_of_customer, 2)
```
>The Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is $1,213.97.
-> This means that, on average, it costs $1,213.97 to acquire one new customer.
We should consider: Is the value and long-term revenue from each new customer worth this cost?

### 2.  ARPU: Average Revenue Per User
`APRU = [Total Revenue] / [Number of Users]`

Total Revenue
```
total_revenue = customer_recepts_202303['receipt_amount'].sum()
```
 `83033`

Number of Customer
```
number_of_customer = customer_recepts_202303['customer_id'].nunique()
```
 `292`

APRU
```
ARPU = round(total_revenue/number_of_customer, 2)
```
 `284.36`
 
=> We can understand that ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) is $284.36, meaning that on average, each customer generates $284.36 in revenue for the business. This metric helps evaluate how effectively the company earns revenue per customer and serves as a basis for comparing with CAC to assess the potential profitability of acquiring new customers.

### 3. COGS: Cost of Goods Sold
`COGS = [Software Expenses] + [Production]`

`Software Expenses` : Calculates the total software expenses for production (COGS) in March 2023, including AWS Hosting, Google Cloud Storage, and Atlassian Jira.
```
production_expense = ['AWS Hosting','Google Cloud Storage','Atlassian Jira']
softwware_expense = expense_202303[expense_202303['item'].isin(production_expense)]['amount'].sum()
```
Total : `14200`

`Shared Expense `: When calculating COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), only the expenses directly related to production should be included. For shared software like Slack and Zoomâ€”which are used across multiple departmentsâ€”we allocate 60% of their total cost to COGS, assuming that portion supports production activities. The remaining 40% is considered indirect and not production-related. This allocation ensures the production cost is accurately reflected in financial reporting.
```
share_softwware = ['Slack','Zoom']
share_softwware = expense_202303[expense_202303['item'].isin(share_softwware)]['amount'].sum() * 0.6
```
Total: `864.0`

`Production Salarry`: The salary cost of the Engineering department in March is considered the Production Salary, as this department is directly involved in creating the product. Therefore, the entire salary amount is included in the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold).
```
production_salary = pay_roll_202303[pay_roll_202303['department'] == 'Engineering']['paid'].sum()
```
Total : `5200`

COGS Calculation:
```
cogs = softwware_expense + share_softwware + production_salary
```

Total : `20264.0`
>The total COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) for March 2023 is $20,264.00, representing the direct production costs required to deliver the product or service.

### 4. Gross margin
`Gross Margin = ([Revenue - COGS) / Revenue) * 100`
```
gross_margin = round((total_revenue - cogs) / total_revenue * 100, 2)
```
Total: `75.6`
The Gross Margin for March 2023 is `75.6%`, indicating that the business retains 75.6% of its revenue after covering direct production costs (COGS).

### 5. LTV: Customer Lifetime Value
LTV = ARPU * [Customer Lifespan] * Gross Margin
```
lifespan.sample(5)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f98340c-c70f-49ed-a70a-6ccadf2e7cfe)

```
lifespan['lifespan_days'] = pd.to_datetime(lifespan['churn_date']) - pd.to_datetime(lifespan['start_date'])
lifespan['lifespan_days'] = lifespan['lifespan_days'].dt.days
lifespan.sample(5)
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c16739e9-d77b-48ac-a985-4d6c1a5341ec)

```
avg_lifespan_month = lifespan['lifespan_days'].mean() / 30
avg_lifespan_month
```
Total:`9.841333333333333`

> Based on the average ARPU, customer lifespan, and gross margin, we estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to be approximately $2,115.65. This is a key metric for evaluating the effectiveness of investments in customer acquisition and retention.

### 5.  LTV / CAC

``` ltv_cac = ltv / cac```
Total:`1.7427548038913647`

>The LTV/CAC ratio is approximately 1.74, indicating that for every $1 spent on acquiring a customer, the business earns about $1.74 in customer lifetime value. This suggests moderate profitability, but there may be room to improve marketing efficiency or increase customer value.

# <span style="color:blue">IV.  CONCLUSION:</span>

>The business generates an average of $2,115.65 from each customer over their lifecycle while spending $1,213.97 to acquire them, resulting in a moderate LTV/CAC ratio of 1.74.
>While this indicates a positive return, it suggests there is room for improvementâ€”either by reducing acquisition costs or increasing customer value.
>The high gross margin (75.6%) shows healthy profitability after production costs, which supports further investment in customer acquisition if optimized.
>What Problem Was Solved?
>We quantified the balance between customer acquisition cost and customer value, helping the business make data-driven decisions on whether current marketing and retention strategies are financially sustainable >and profitable in the long term.
